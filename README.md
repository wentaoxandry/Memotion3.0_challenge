# Memotion3.0_challenge
Implementation of our Memotion 3.0 challenge. The challenge provides an English and a mixed Hindi-English meme dataset for three classification tasks: Task A is sentiment analysis to classify a given meme as positive, negative, or neutral. In Task B, emotion classification, a meme should be identified as humorous, sarcastic, offensive, or motivational. Finally, Task C asks to predict the intensity of the emotion classes in Task B. We won the best ranks on the two final Tasks B and C, with respective scores of 0.7977 and 0.5982.
